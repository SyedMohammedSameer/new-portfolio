# Mohammed Sameer Syed Portfolio
Welcome to my Portfolio ðŸ‘‹!!!

A passionate Software Engineer and Machine Learning enthusiast, currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Machine Learning at the University of Arizona. At Lumenci, I lead AI-driven solutions within a backend team, utilizing FastAPI, AutoGPT, and custom AI agents, while deploying Random Forest models for our AI Workbench. Skilled in Python, Data Structures, ML/DL frameworks, and Ethical Hacking (Linux), Iâ€™ve worked on projects in CNN-based Image Recognition, GANs, GNNs, NLP, and LLM fine-tuning with QLORA and SFT.

Outside of tech, I build a high-speed model rocket with a custom flight computer, combining electronics and aerospace. A stargazer and sports fan, Iâ€™m open to AI/ML, software engineering, and interdisciplinary collaborations. Letâ€™s connect! ðŸš€
